# CCTS: Carbon Credit Trading Scheme Simulation

**CCTS** is an agent-based modeling framework designed to simulate Indiaâ€™s Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS).  
It provides a comprehensive, extensible Python package to model firm behaviors, carbon market dynamics, compliance, and economic impacts under the Indian regulatory environment.

---

## Features

- **Agent-Based Firm Modeling:** Detailed behavioral models for firms including production optimization, abatement project selection, emissions tracking, and compliance decisions.
- **Indian Carbon Market Simulation:** Implements a realistic carbon market with trading, price volatility, market stability reserve, credit banking/borrowing, and penalty assessments.
- **Real-World Constraints:** Incorporates project implementation delays, financing constraints, risk aversion, technology adoption, and diminishing returns on abatement.
- **Compliance and Penalties:** Supports annual intensity-based compliance checks, vintage credit expiration, penalties with escalation, and market-compatible credit surrendering.
- **Data Collection and Analysis:** Integrated data collectors for stepwise simulation output and advanced analysis tools for market performance, compliance rates, economic impacts, and sector-level insights.
- **Configurable Scenarios:** Flexible configuration framework with predefined scenarios, enabling testing of policy reforms, market stress testing, technology push scenarios, and more.
- **Visualization and Reporting:** Generates time series plots, sector trends, transaction logs, and Excel reports facilitating easy interpretation of simulation outcomes.
- **Open Source and Extensible:** Built on Mesa, NumPy, Pandas, and other scientific libraries to allow users to customize and extend the simulation logic.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Recommended: Use a virtual environment for package isolation

### Install via PyPI (upcoming)

pip install ccts

text

### Install directly from GitHub

pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/ccts.git

text

### Development Installation

Clone the repository and install in editable mode:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ccts.git
cd ccts
pip install -e .

text

### Install dependencies manually

If you prefer, install dependencies yourself:

pip install -r requirements.txt

text

---

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Run simulations with customizable input and output parameters:

ccts --firms-csv input/firms.csv --scenario baseline --steps 24 --out-dir output

text

Common CLI options:

- `--firms-csv` : Path to the CSV with firm data
- `--scenario` : Name of predefined scenario (e.g., baseline, high_ambition)
- `--steps` : Number of simulation steps (default depends on config)
- `--out-dir` : Directory to save outputs (default: `output/`)

### Python API

You can import and use the core classes and run customized workflows:

from ccts.model import CCTSModel
import pandas as pd

Load firm data
firm_data = pd.read_csv('input/firms.csv')

Prepare configuration and market params (dicts or from config module)
model_config = {} # Your config dictionary here
market_params = {}

Initialize model
model = CCTSModel(firm_data, market_params, model_config)

Run steps
for _ in range(24):
model.step()

Access data
agent_data = model.datacollector.get_agent_vars_dataframe()

text

---

## Configuration

Configuration is highly flexible:

- Edit fallback/default parameters in `ccts/config.py`
- Override parameters via JSON or CSV config files
- Scenarios like `baseline`, `high_ambition`, `low_liquidity` come preloaded
- Configure market parameters, agent behavior, sector benchmarks, compliance rates
- Advanced toggles for learning, banking, borrowing, price caps, volatility, and penalties

---

## Outputs

- **Agent and Model Time Series:** Detailed stepwise logged variables for analysis
- **Transactions Logs:** Comprehensive carbon market transaction data
- **Annual Summaries:** Yearly aggregated statistics on emissions, compliance, market volume
- **Plots and Visuals:** Time series of carbon price, market liquidity, sector emissions trends, etc.
- **Excel Reports:** Multi-sheet summaries for easy exploration of results
